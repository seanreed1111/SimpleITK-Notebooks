    "Reading and Writing\n",
    "SimpleITK can read and write images stored in a single file, or a set of files (e.g. DICOM series).\n",
    "\n",
    "Images stored in the DICOM format have a meta-data dictionary associated with them, which is populated with the DICOM tags. When a DICOM series is read as a single image, the meta-data information is not available since DICOM tags are specific to each file. If you need the meta-data, you have three options:\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the object oriented interface's [ImageSeriesReader](https://simpleitk.org/doxygen/latest/html/classitk_1_1simple_1_1ImageSeriesReader.html) class, configure it to load the tags using the MetaDataDictionaryArrayUpdateOn method and possibly the LoadPrivateTagsOn method if you need the private tags. Once the series is read you can access the meta-data from the series reader using the GetMetaDataKeys, HasMetaDataKey, and GetMetaData.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the object oriented interface's ImageFileReader, set a specific slice's file name and only read it's meta-data using the ReadImageInformation method which only reads the meta-data but not the bulk pixel information. Once the meta-data is read you can access it from the file reader using the GetMetaDataKeys, HasMetaDataKey, and GetMetaData.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the object oriented interface's ImageFileReader, set a specific slice's file name and read it. Or using the procedural interface's, ReadImage function, read a specific file. You can then access the meta-data directly from the Image using the GetMetaDataKeys, HasMetaDataKey, and GetMetaData.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following cell, we read an image in JPEG format, and write it as PNG and BMP. File formats are deduced from the file extension. Appropriate pixel type is also set - you can override this and force a pixel type of your choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: When reading an image series, via the ImageSeriesReader or via the procedural ReadImage interface, the images in the list are assumed to be ordered correctly (GetGDCMSeriesFileNames ensures this for DICOM). If the order is incorrect, the image will be read, but its spacing and possibly the direction cosine matrix will be incorrect."
